# UvA, FACT-AI 2020 course: Deep Learning for Case-Based Reasoning through Prototypes: A Neural Network that Explains Its Predictions

This repository contains the reproduction source code, results and extended methods on the ["Deep Learning for Case-Based Reasoning through Prototypes: A Neural Network that Explains Its Predictions"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04806) paper.

The authors of this implementation are the students: Albert Harkema, Anna Langedijk, Christiaan van der Vlist, Hinrik Sn√¶r.

The supporting material re-implements the original approach, successfully reproducing the results and expand the prototype network with a hierarchical subnetwork aiming to bring more explainability and transparency to the end-to-end neural architecture.

The jupyter notebook can be run to evaluate the existing algorithm and the training scripts are provided for reproducibility.
